# notexpress

A small NodeJS framework that is not a replacement of ExpressJS. Just like Express.js, it is unopinionated and minimal and contains up to 80% of the features in Express.js. I only hope the percentage will increase.

```
const notexpress = require('@ndimz/notexpress')
const app = new notexpress()

app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send('Goodday World')
})

app.listen(5000)
```

## Features

- ‚öô Express middleware compatible
- üöÄ No legacy dependencies, just the JavaScript itself
- üç™ Built-in cookie parser
- üì¶ Lesser bundle size than Express

Visit [notexpress](https://ndimz.gitbook.io/notexpress/) website for documentation.

## Installation

The only requirement to use notexpress is that you have Node.js installed.

```bash
  npm install @ndimz/notexpress
```

## Disclaimer

This entire project is just a **POK**, **Proof of Knowledge**. If that's even a thing. I am merely experimenting my knowledge of Node.js, thereby attempting to build my own Express. Most of the things you can do with Express are **not yet** doable. But hopefully, I will fully implement them.
